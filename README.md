Introduction

The Cognitive Hierarchical Transformer (CHT) is an innovative architectural blueprint envisioned to build upon the foundational Transformer model. By integrating concepts from hierarchical processing, Integrated Information Theory (IIT), dynamic adaptability, and modular design, CHT aims to create a more powerful, flexible, and capable AI system. This blueprint outlines the foundational ideas and serves as a call to action for developers and researchers interested in pioneering this next-generation AI architecture.

Core Principles

1. Hierarchical Processing
Processes information at multiple abstraction levels for a nuanced understanding of complex data.

Inspired by hierarchical models in AI literature and hierarchical attention mechanisms.



2. Integrated Information
Promotes the integration of information through feedback mechanisms and re-entrant pathways.

Based on Integrated Information Theory (IIT).



3. Dynamic Adaptability
Incorporates self-control mechanisms to balance internal motivations and external influences.

Enhances the model's ability to adapt to new environments and tasks.



4. Modular Design
Consists of interchangeable modules for flexibility and ease of adaptation to different tasks.

Facilitates incremental development and testing.




Architectural Components

1. Input Layer
Adaptive Tokenization

Dynamically adjusts tokenization based on input text.

Utilizes subword unit-level tokenization with the ability to modify dynamically.


Context-Dependent Embeddings
Converts tokens into embeddings considering surrounding words and document structure.

Incorporates multiple embedding tables for speaker and categorical information.


Positional Embeddings
Adds positional information to token embeddings to preserve token sequence order.



2. Hierarchical Attention Layers
Multi-Level Attention

Employs multiple attention layers operating at different abstraction levels.

Lower layers focus on local relationships; higher layers capture global dependencies.


Sparse Attention

Reduces computational cost by focusing on key token relationships.

Implements various sparse attention patterns.


Learnable Biases

Augments attention mechanisms with learnable biases to determine token affinities.



3. Processing Blocks
Re-entrant Blocks
Includes feedback loops to increase information integration.
Each block comprises multi-headed attention, feedforward networks, and layer normalization.
Variable number of layers per block.


Dynamic Routing
Routes information to different network parts based on input and context.
Enhances flexibility and adaptability.


Recurrent Layers
Introduces recurrent layers between blocks to improve short-term memory.



4. External Memory Module
Memory Interaction
Maintains information beyond current block size via external memory.
Interacts with processing blocks using cross attention (keys and values from memory; queries from current block).



5. Feedforward Networks
Conditional Computation
Allows different tokens to engage in different computations based on conditions.


Alternative Activation Functions
Explores activation functions beyond ReLU or GELU for improved performance.



6. Normalization Layers
Adaptive Layer Normalization
Adapts normalization based on input while incorporating learned parameters.
Considers positional information during normalization.



7. Output Layer
Linear Layer
Transforms the final block's output into logits for prediction.



Training and Optimization
Multi-Task Learning
Trains on multiple auxiliary tasks alongside primary language modeling to enhance generalization.


Bayesian Analysis
Utilizes Bayesian methods to quantify the model's 'consciousness' during training and evaluation.


Ensemble Learning
Trains an ensemble of sub-networks to improve robustness during inference.


Thematic Interpretation
Applies social interaction and cognitive theories to interpret model behavior.



Implementation Strategy

1. Start Simple
Begin with a smaller model implementing core hierarchical structures and attention mechanisms.
Incrementally add layers and features.



2. Modular Approach
Ensure components are modular for easy addition, removal, or modification.



3. Systematic Evaluation
Use appropriate metrics to assess performance and architectural changes.



4. Utilize Existing Resources
Leverage libraries like PyTorch for implementation and training.



5. Track Experiments
Maintain detailed records of architectural changes and their impacts to ensure reproducibility.
